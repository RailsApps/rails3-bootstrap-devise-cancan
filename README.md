# Rollbar Demo Rails App

A demo app to show off Rollbar, the error tracking service. In the wild at [rollbar-rails-demo.herokuapp.com](http://rollbar-rails-demo.herokuapp.com/).

Errors in this app are tracked and reported to [this demo project in Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/demo). Click around in the app and see what shows up in the Rollbar project.
